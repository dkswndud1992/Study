# Django vs Spring

Django
------
- Good
    1) Rapid development is possible
    2) Good scalability
    3) Built-in templates for creating apps (login, RSS, sitemap, etc.)
    4) It is possible to proceed with development without a framework for the front-end.
 
- Bad
    1) If English is difficult, there may be problems in finding materials.
 
Spring
------
- Good
    1) Powerful and convenient
    2) Stability, reliability and security
    3) Multithreaded
 
- Bad
    1) As the used dependency list increases, the application may become heavy or the development environment may become complicated.
    2) Components are so diverse that if you have little background knowledge, you may find it difficult to choose.
    3) Complex setup
