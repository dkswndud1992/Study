# Humanities vs Engineering

These days, humanities majors are disappearing, and engineering majors are emerging. 
In South Korea, you can easier get a job if you study engineering. 
I was saddened by this reality. 
So I analyzed it. 
<br/><br/>

|Humanities|Engineering
|-|-
|Context-oriented (comprehensive)|Text-oriented (emphasis on clarity)
|emotional|logical
|Relational Thinking|Equal Thinking
|Demand from below|Demand from above
|A and B are different.| A is right and B is wrong.

<br/>

These two are complementary to each other. 
If engineering is cold, humanities are hot. 
Engineering makes rational decisions, 
and humanities move the human mind. 
If you majored in the humanities, you should be able to see the world through the eyes of an engineering student, 
and if you majored in engineering, you should be able to speak to the world through the mouth of a humanities student.
