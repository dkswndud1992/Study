# Before my story

Once upon a time...
<br/>
<br/>
I was born in an ordinary family in Korea.
My grandfather gave me the name Joo-Young.
He admired Hyundai Chairman Chung Ju-young, and he must have wanted me to succeed as well like Chung Ju-young.
It is said that my grandfather was discharged after being shot in the foot during the Korean War.
I remember walking with a limp when I was little.
My parents both worked, so I was raised mainly by my grandmother and grandfather.
<br/>
<br/>
When I was young, I was very immature.
Weak to the strong, strong to the weak.
I am very sorry for not being nice to my brother.
I painted a picture on the wall. like a caveman.
It was nice to make something and get people's attention.
I didn't like the inclusive education, so I just focused on coming up with ideas.
left no record. Because space is limited.
I liked drawing paper where I could express my thoughts.
Aimed at design.
In order to do something big like Chairman Chung Ju-young, I entered the Department of Interior Design.
<br/>
<br/>
I wandered a lot during my freshman year of college.
It was just a line drawing, not a design I wanted to do.
There were also troubles with seniors.
I played without going to school.
I am very sorry to my parents.
It was a series of troubles without a choice.
That's how my time gradually disappeared.
<br/>
<br/>
Before and after enlisting in the military, I did interior work.
to differentiate themselves from others.
And in the army, he served as a mortar artilleryman.
I also read a lot of books in the army.
History, language, personal development, programming, fiction.
I went back to school with a new dream and new weapon.
<br/>
<br/>
I went back to school and got a girlfriend.
she is his current wife.
The spring breeze blew sweetly.
And the wind of the fourth revolution also blew.
Entrepreneurial winds began to blow everywhere.
My heart caught fire.
Design alone doesn't work in real world.
After graduation, I enrolled in a programming academy.
<br/>
<br/>
The programming academy taught me basic languages ​​and programming methods.
learned big data and artificial intelligence.
learned the drone.
learned 3D printer.
learned the web.
learned the app.
learned the robot.
learned to plan.
learned design.
I learned everything thinly.
I was greedy.
I just made a plan without executing it.
That's how I became a useless generalist.
<br/>
<br/>
It is very difficult for non-major newcomers to enter the company.
I entered the meal program company with difficulty.
There was more phone work than programming.
The working was also just maintenance of the old one.
I didn't feel like I was getting better skill.
I quit my first company after 3 months.
The second company was a web crawling startup, whose CEO was a developer.
It was good to learn many things, such as how to code well and how to communicate.
However, it came out after 3 months as the company's financial situation became difficult.
After that, I entered another fintech startup.
I started to cut staff because I couldn't get investment here either, and eventually I came out.
The company I worked for recently was a water resources company and it was a growing company.
I went there for about 3 years, but decided to change jobs for greater growth.
<br/>
<br/>
I am taking a break now.
During the 10-day break, it was time to settle my mind.
I was able to identify my weaknesses and strengths.
What I lacked was speaking and writing.
Fortunately, I was exercising little by little.
my strengths are gamification, programming, and self-improvement.
I will write and speak these things and make them powerful weapons.
<br/>
<br/>
The end.
