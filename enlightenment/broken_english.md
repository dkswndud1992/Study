# What is meant by broken English?

Broken English is a name for a non-standard, non-traditionally spoken or alternatively-written version of the English language. These forms of English are sometimes considered as a pidgin if they have derived in a context where more than one language is used.

In Korean, it is called Konglish.

I am using Konglish. But in the future, I expect to use English fluently. To do that, I study English every day. So, the articles on Github are also written in English.

There is a saying in Belize in my memory. "go slow, but keep going"
