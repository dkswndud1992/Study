# Gamification

**Describtion**
- Inducing people's active participation by applying game-like content to things that are generally unrelated to games. Originally this is known to have been used as a marketing term for companies, but to be precise, it is an element that has been continuously receiving attention as an industrial element and has been developed since the first mention by programmer Nick Pelling in 2002.
